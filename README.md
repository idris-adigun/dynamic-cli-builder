**Dynamic CLI Builder** simplifies the creation of _interactive, configurable_ command-line interfaces (CLI) for your Python scripts.
Define your commands declaratively in YAML or JSON, register the corresponding Python functions, and obtain a production-ready CLI complete with validation, logging, and an optional interactive mode.

## Features

- üèóÔ∏è  Declarative ‚Äì design your CLI in YAML/JSON, no `argparse` boilerplate
- ‚öôÔ∏è  Highly customizable with pluggable validators and hooks
- üîÄ Supports nested commands & multiple command structures
- üñ•Ô∏è  Optional interactive mode for prompting missing arguments
- üîí Built-in validation rules (min/max, regex, choices, etc.)
- üìú Structured, configurable logging

## Installation

To install Dynamic CLI Builder, use the following command:

```bash
pip install dynamic-cli-builder
```

## Quick Start

Here is a simple example to get you started:

### 1. Create Actions

Actions are basically function to be executed base on command. <br> For instance _actions.py_

```python
def say_hello(name: str, age: int):
    print(f"Hello {name}!, you are {age} years old.")

# Action Registry
ACTIONS = {
    "say_hello": say_hello,
}
```

you can have multiple function registered

### 2. Define YAML/JSON Config

_config.yaml_

```yaml
description: "Dynamic CLI Builder Example"
commands:
  - name: say_hello
    description: "Say Hello..."
    args:
      - name: name
        type: str
        help: "Name of the user."
    action: say_hello
```

```json
{
	"description": "Dynamic CLI JSON",
	"commands": [
		{
			"name": "say_hello",
			"description": "Say hello...",
			"args": [
				{
					"name": "name",
					"type": "str",
					"help": "Name of the User.",
					"rules": ""
				}
			],
			"action": "say_hello"
		}
	]
}
```

### 3. Add Validation Rules

- min, max validation

```yaml
description: "Dynamic CLI Builder Example"
commands:
  - name: say_hello
    description: "Say Hello..."
    args:
      - name: name
        type: str
        help: "Name of the user."
        rules: ""
      - name: age
        type: int
        help: "Age of the user."
        rules:
          min: 1
          max: 99
    action: say_hello
```

In Json:

```json
{
	"description": "Dynamic CLI JSON",
	"commands": [
		{
			"name": "say_hello",
			"description": "Say hello...",
			"args": [
				{
					"name": "name",
					"type": "str",
					"help": "Name of the User.",
					"rules": ""
				},
				{
					"name": "age",
					"type": "str",
					"help": "Age of the User.",
					"rules": {
						"min": 1,
						"max": 10
					}
				}
			],
			"action": "say_hello"
		}
	]
}
```

- for more control, you could also use regex

```yaml
description: "Dynamic CLI Builder Example"
commands:
  - name: say_hello
    description: "Say Hello..."
    args:
      - name: name
        type: str
        help: "Name of the user."
        rules: ""
        required: True
      - name: age
        type: int
        help: "Age of the user."
        rules:
          regex: "^[1-9][0-9]$"
        required: True
    action: say_hello
```

or json equivalent

```json
{
  "description": "Dynamic CLI JSON",
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "say_hello",
      "description": "Say hello...",
      "args": [
          {
              "name": "name",
              "type": "str",
              "help": "Name of the User.",
              "rules": "",
              "required": true
          },
          {
              "name": "age",
              "type": "str",
              "help": "Age of the User.",
              "required": true
              "rules": {
                  "regex": "^[1-9][0-9]$"
              }
          }
      ],
      "action": "say_hello"

    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Run the Builder (_main.py_)

To bind this all together

```python
from dynamic_cli_builder import run_builder
from actions import ACTIONS

run_builder('config.yaml', ACTIONS)
```

## Command Reference

### Global Help

```
python3 <name_of_main_file> -h
```

For Instance:

```
python3 main.py -h
```

### Command-Specific Help

```
 python3 <name_of_main_file> <name_of_command> -h
```

For Instance:

```
python3 main.py say_hello --name world --age 99
```

You should see

> Hello World!, you are 99 years old

## Logging & Interactive Mode

logging is set to false by default, to enable logging add _-log_ to your command just after the file name

```
python3 main.py -log say_hello --name world --age 99
```

Output:

> 2025-01-29 12:08:19,518 - INFO - Building CLI with config.

> 2025-01-29 12:08:19,532 - INFO - Executing command: say_hello

> Hello World!, you are 99 years old.



Interactive mode is set to false by default to enable interactive mode, add _-im_ to your command For instance:

```
python3 main.py -im say_hello --name world --age 99
```

## Running the CLI

### 1. Recommended (v0.2+)

Use the module entry-point shipped in `__main__.py`. No imports required ‚Äì just point the runner at a config file and an *actions* registry:

```bash
# auto-discover config.yaml & actions.py in CWD
python -m dynamic_cli_builder say_hello --name Alice --age 25

# explicit paths
python -m dynamic_cli_builder \
    --config path/to/config.yaml \
    --actions path/to/actions.py \
    --log-level DEBUG \
    say_hello --name Alice
```

Flags:
* `--config/-c` ‚Äì YAML/JSON config. If omitted the loader searches `config.{yaml,yml,json}` in CWD.
* `--actions/-a` ‚Äì Python file exposing `ACTIONS` dict. Defaults to `actions.py` in CWD.
* `--log-level/-v` ‚Äì `DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL` (default `WARNING`). The legacy `-log` flag still enables INFO for backward-compat.
* `-im` ‚Äì Interactive Mode; prompts for any missing arguments.

### 2. Legacy API (‚â§ v0.1)

If you were importing functions directly, the *shim* in `dynamic_cli_builder.cli` keeps things working ‚Äì but prefer the new API above.

```python
from dynamic_cli_builder import cli  # legacy shim
from my_actions import ACTIONS

config = cli.load_config("config.yaml")
parser = cli.build_cli(config)
args = parser.parse_args()
cli.execute_command(args, config, ACTIONS)
```

All helpers (`build_cli`, `execute_command`, `validate_arg`, etc.) are re-exported so old code continues to run unchanged.

## Roadmap

> **Compatibility policy**: We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). All patch and minor releases will remain backward-compatible. Breaking changes will be introduced only in the next **major** release and will be accompanied by a detailed migration guide.



### Mid-term (v0.3.x)
- Enrich validation rules (choices, default values, conditional validation)
- Validate configs with `pydantic` or `jsonschema` before building the CLI
- Provide an interactive wizard for generating YAML/JSON configs
- Automate semantic versioning & releases via `semantic-release` or `bumpver`

### Long-term (v1.0)
- Migrate command parsing to `typer` for rich help text, autocompletion and colored output
- Introduce a plugin architecture for custom argument types, validators and output handlers
- Publish full documentation site (Sphinx + ReadTheDocs) with tutorials and API reference
- Achieve >90 % test coverage and add performance benchmarks
- Offer a Docker image and Gitpod template for instant try-out

### Nice-to-have Explorations
- Terminal UI (TUI) mode powered by `textual` / `rich`
- VS Code extension for live schema preview and command auto-completion
